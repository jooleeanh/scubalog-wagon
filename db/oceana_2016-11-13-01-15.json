Unlike most crustaceans, however, adult barnacles are sessile – they can’t move. After a short phase spent as planktonic larvae, barnacles settle, attach to a hard substrate, and never move again. The Acorn Barnacle is one species in a large group of species with the same common name that do not have stalks and instead attach their shells directly to the substrate. Gooseneck Barnacles are a common example of the stalked variety. Acorn Barnacles live along rocky shores throughout the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans.",

Its yellow eye is usually the only part of the cuttlefish that pokes above the sea floor.  At night, the cuttlefish emerges to feed on small shrimp and fish. Two long fins flank the sides of the striped pyjama squid's body and the arms of its two feeding tentacles have small suckers, each with a toothed horny rim. The underside of its body is covered in small glands that secrete slime when the striped pyjama squid is under attack, quickly scaring off any predators from making a move. It can also drastically change color to a dark purple-brown, making it easier to camouflage itself against rocks and corals near the bottom of the ocean.The male pyjama squid begins mating by grabbing a female and positioning itself so that they are head-to-head.  He then places his sperm packet close to her mouth where she stores it to use when she lays her eggs.  If the male finds sperm from a previous male, he will attempt to remove it with a specialized scoop on his lower arm.  Females lay round white eggs in little clumps on the seafloor or under coral rubble, and young hatchlings are born with their black pyjama stripes already fully visible. Striped pyjama squid will only reach about 7 centimeters in length when fully grown.Data are lacking on the conservation status of striped pyjama squids. They are not typically targeted by commercial fishing, but their shallow coastal habitat is susceptible to human impact. More research is needed to fully understand the status of the striped pyjama squid and their future in our oceans. To help support our work protecting sea life from dangerous threats, click here to donate today!Additional Resources:"

With tentacles up to 190 feet long and a bell diameter of almost 7 feet wide, some individuals even rival in size the blue whale, the largest animal in the world. Most lion’s mane jellyfish live in the Arctic and North Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Washington where the waters are cool. Its ‘mane’ of long, hair-like tentacles hanging from the underside of its bell-shaped body is the inspiration behind the lion mane’s common name. The mouth is situated on the bell’s underside, surrounded by tentacles that are divided into eight clusters of up to 150 tentacles each. These tentacles are equipped with nematocysts containing poison that stun prey when they are enveloped. The top of the bell is usually dark yellow or red in color and thick in the center, but thins out towards the edges. The lion’s mane jellyfish also possess bioluminescent abilities, meaning it’s able to produce its own light and glow in the dark underwater.Using the powerful sting of its tentacles, the lion’s mane jellyfish catches small fishes, tiny crustaceans and even other jellyfish to satisfy its diet. Lion’s mane jellyfish are continual swimmers that can cover great distances when strong marine currents are present, and while most individuals prefer to swim solo, large swarms occasionally occur when storms and tides are prevalent. The lion’s mane jellyfish breeds in March and early May via external fertilization. Larvae will settle on the seabed and develop into polyps that eventually grow into jellyfish within 30-40 days.Scientific research has suggested that jellyfish actually thrive in areas that are affected by human activity. Overfishing, climate change and pollution have helped promote more frequent jellyfish swarms while reducing the jellies’ main predators and competitors and increasing their prey. These factors have created a favorable environment for this species, and few threats are known to the lion’s main jellyfish or other jellies."

                "description_full": "Baleen whales are known to be some of the largest animals on Earth, and the bowhead whale is no exception. These whales are on average 50 feet long and weigh 60-80 tons. Rows of vertical baleen, or comb-like teeth that help the bowhead strain huge volumes of water to capture food, are the largest of any whale at almost 175 inches long. Additionally, a bowhead whale skull can take up almost a third of its body length, which helps the whale punch through sea ice almost 8 inches thick. But, that doesn’t mean the whales swim away unscathed. Bowhead whales have many scars on their bodies from shattering ice and these markings help scientists identify individual whales.Bowheads are usually solitary swimmers, but will sometimes feed in groups of up to 14 individual whales. A bowhead whale’s diet consists largely of zooplankton, which they filter out through their baleen plates. Bowhead whales spend most of their day with their mouth wide open, grazing the surface for food, and a single whale may eat more than 100 metric tons of crustaceans per year. Bowhead whales also have excellent hearing— their ears are designed for low-frequency sound, which is extremely important in their underwater habitat, which is challenging to see in.  Although it is difficult to tell age in a species that does not have teeth, scientists believe bowhead whales may be one of the longest-lived animals on the planet, capable of reaching more than 100 years old. (Read more about longevity secrets from marine animals on our blog!)Bowhead whales are one of the only cetaceans that spend their entire lives in the Arctic. Rather than migrating to warmer waters when the seasons change, bowhead whales migrate within the waters of the Northern Hemisphere, including the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Breeding season occurs between April and June during the spring migration, and most females will give birth to a new calf every 3 to 6 years. A calf is capable of swimming on its own immediately after birth, but the mother and calf will maintain a close bond with each other for several months, rarely leaving the other’s side.The bowhead whale was once considered economically valuable for its long baleen and thick blubber.  They were commercially hunted beginning in at least the 1600s and maybe earlier. By the 1920s, the worldwide abundance had been reduced to about 3,000. The International Whaling Commission has protected bowhead whales from commercial whaling since 1946. Even so, less than 30 years ago in the 1980’s, bowhead whales were still considered endangered by the IUCN Red List. Today, populations are recovering and the species is now of least concern on the Red List Category & Criteria. However, since the 1970’s, oil and gas exploration in the Arctic has left these whales at risk for noise disturbance from seismic airguns and potential oil spills.

One of the most abundant populations of false killer whales can be found offshore from Hawaii and comprises roughly 1,550 individuals. Within these populations, false killer whales often break off into smaller, more stable groups of 15 to 25 individuals. Studies have shown that false killer whales form strong social bonds within the groups lasting several years. Together, false killer whales are cooperative hunters, foraging for squid and large fish, like tuna, mahi mahi and wahoo, and sharing the prey among each other.False killer whales are identifiable by their rounded heads, small dorsal fin and dark gray bodies. They are most closely related to Risso’s dolphins and pilot whales, rather than killer whales as their name suggests. Playful and active, false killer whales are fast swimmers and can frequently be seen surfing the bow waves of vessels or poking out of the water. Like other dolphin species, they use echolocation to communicate and sense prey and their surroundings. False killer whales have a slow life history—females reach sexual maturity at about 10 years of age and may only have a calf every six or seven years. Calves are born just six feet in length, and will feed on the mother’s milk for up to two years.Though false killer whales are listed as data deficient by the IUCN Red List, the main Hawaiian Islands population is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. As overfishing of commercially important fish stocks continue, false killer whales will have less to eat.

                "description_full": "The gray seal lives in North Atlantic waters and is divided into three distinct stocks—the North Atlantic stock, the Baltic Sea stock and the eastern North Atlantic stock. In these waters, gray seals experience cold temperatures and sub-arctic environments. Males will come ashore, including onto ice, to mate, often competing with each other for access to females. Females remain on land at pupping sites called rookeries to nurse newborn pups. These pups, which are born with stark white fur, look unrecognizable next to the parents but will quickly shed this fur for the mottled brown and silver fur that adults have. From birth to three weeks old, a gray seal pup may gain up to three pounds a day feeding on the mother’s nutrient-rich milk. A pup can survive off blubber reserves for several weeks as it waits to shed its lighter fur before going to sea and dispersing across large areas. Male gray seals can reach 10 feet long and more than 850 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 7.5 feet long and 550 pounds.When not on land, adult gray seals visit the water to hunt for food, like fish, crustaceans, squid and octopus, gobbling up between four to six percent of their body weight every day. A gray seal can dive to depths of up to 230 feet on average to swallow fish and other creatures, or to bring larger food to the surface to break up in pieces for eating. A gray seal can hold its breath for more than an hour at a time. Groups of gray seals will sometimes engage in “social feeding,” in which several individuals work together to better prevent prey from swimming away. Gray seals can fall prey to killer whales and sharks as they rest on the water’s surface, keeping their head and neck above the water to breathe.Gray seals are considered of least concern by the IUCN Red List. However, these marine mammals are known to get caught up in fishing nets and are even targeted by fishermen in certain areas. Some countries allow gray seals to be legally killed to control populations and reduce the seal’s impact on commercially important fish stocks that may make up the seal’s diet. Gray seals are protected in the United States by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), but continue to be threatened by boat strikes, dangerous fishing gear and marine debris.To help support our work protecting gray seals from dangerous threats, click here to donate today! Additional Resources:"

The dolphin's second white patch begins where the other ends and narrows at the tail, creating the iconic hourglass illusion. The hourglass dolphin is the only small dolphin that swims south of the Antarctic convergence where cold Antarctic waters meet the slightly warmer waters of the sub-antarctic. The largest concentrations of hourglass dolphins have been sighted in Drake Passage, which lies between the tip of South America and Antarctica.Similar to other cetaceans, hourglass dolphins swim in groups called pods that can reach up to 100 individuals. However, the average hourglass pod is closer to 14 or less individuals. Swimming at speeds of up to 22 km/h, hourglass dolphins are notorious for riding the waves of fast boats and spraying the surface with sea water as they come up for air. Hourglass dolphins live on a diet of fish, squid and crustaceans and feed at the surface, which often draws a crowd of sea birds and helps research vessels spot the groups of dolphins. The reproductive habits of hourglass dolphins have not been observed, but relatives of this species, like the Pacific white-sided dolphin and the dusky dolphin, give birth every 28 months between August and October.An estimated 144,300 hourglass dolphins remain south of the Antarctic convergence. There are no direct threats to this species, largely because their remote habitat is rarely visited by humans. However, climate change could still pose a threat to hourglass dolphins in the near future. Climate change has the potential to raise sea temperatures significantly, which could disrupt vital marine ecosystems that have adapted to the cold water.To help support our work protecting other dolphin species from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a dolphin from our store!Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "Like many open ocean bony fishes, Atlantic Bluefin Tuna start out as extremely tiny larvae, no more than a few millimeters long and weighing only a few hundredths of a gram.  Within three to five years, individuals reach lengths of three feet (~ one meter) and are sexually mature.  Because Atlantic Bluefin Tunas undergo such an amazing transformation in size (from being nearly microscopic to being one of the largest open ocean predators), they eat a wide variety of prey throughout their lifetimes.  At a young age, they eat tiny zooplankton, and their prey increases in size as they do.  As adults, they eat fairly large bony fishes and invertebrates.  Similarly, Atlantic Bluefin Tuna are eaten by a wide variety of predators.  When they are newly hatched, they are eaten by other fishes that specialize on eating plankton.  At that life stage, their numbers are reduced dramatically.  Those that survive face a steady increase in the size of their predators.  Adult Atlantic Bluefin are not eaten by anything other than the very largest billfishes, toothed whales, and some open ocean shark species. Bluefin Tuna are known to be highly migratory, with individuals making long migrations every year.  These migrations correspond with their spawning behavior and with their food needs.  This species reproduces via broadcast spawning, where several females and several males release millions of eggs and sperm into the water column at the same time.  This method increases the likelihood that the eggs will be fertilized and decreases the chances that they will be eaten by egg predators.  There are at least two known populations of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna, one that reproduces in the Gulf of Mexico and one that reproduces in the Mediterranean Sea.  Some researchers believe that the Mediterranean population actually represents two populations (one in the west and one in the east plus the Black Sea).  This further division has some implications for fisheries management, because the fish in the eastern Mediterranean are generally considered more of a conservation concern than those in the western Mediterranean.Though almost all fishes are cold blooded, Atlantic Bluefin have a specialized blood vessel structure – called a countercurrent exchanger – that allows them to maintain a body temperature that is higher than the surrounding water.  This adaptation provides them with a major advantage when hunting in cold water, by allowing them to move more quickly and intelligently.  The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is one of the fastest swimmers in the ocean.  Like some shark species, Atlantic Bluefin must constantly swim.  In order to obtain oxygen from the water, fishes pass water over their gills.  The tunas lack the ability to do so while stopped, so they must continuously swim forward with their mouths open to keep their blood oxygenated.The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is a highly prized food fish and is fished heavily throughout its range.  Its value in the high-grade sushi market in Japan and elsewhere is high enough to cause fishers to target this species with almost unmatched effort.  Scientists believe the species to be endangered (highly vulnerable to extinction), but fisheries managers continue to allow commercial fishing to target it.  While the Atlantic Bluefin was formerly common in the Black Sea and off the coast of Brazil, it has not been observed in significant numbers in either of those places for several decades.  As a result of these and other losses, the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna has experienced the largest range contraction of any open ocean species.  Early indications imply that recent strong management regulations may be allowing populations to rebound, but continued conservation and management efforts are required to ensure that more subpopulations are not lost. Note on closely related species:  For many years, bluefin tunas around the northern hemisphere were assumed to all be one species.  Scientists have recognized Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) as a distinct species for quite some time, but the northern species was divided only in the last decade.  Now, the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna and the Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus orientalis) are generally considered to be distinct species.Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "The Atlantic Goliath Grouper, like most groupers, is an ambush predator and eats fairly large fishes and invertebrates and even small sharks.  Reefs with large numbers of predators, like Atlantic Goliath Groupers, are known to be healthier than reefs with no predators, so this species may represent an important part of the reef food web.  Atlantic Goliath Groupers feed by swallowing their prey whole; they do not chew.  They use their very large mouths to create enough negative pressure to suck in whole fishes or large invertebrates, and they swallow them quickly and efficiently.Throughout most of the year, low numbers of Atlantic Goliath Groupers are observed in any one place.  They are at the top of their food web and are therefore naturally rare.  However, during reproduction (immediately after the full moons between June and December), they come together in groups of at least 100 individuals.  These groups are known as spawning aggregations, and they form at relatively few places throughout the species’ range.  Individual Atlantic Goliath Groupers likely travel many miles to reach their preferred spawning sites and form part of the spawning aggregation.  At these sites, the groupers reproduce by a method known as broadcast spawning, where females release eggs and several males release sperm into the water column above deep reefs all at the same time.  This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.Though they were likely naturally rare, scientists believe that destructive fishing practices have reduced the numbers of Atlantic Goliath Groupers by at least 80% and that the species is now critically endangered.  In other words, it is very highly vulnerable to extinction.  These fish utilize the same, few locations and same, few days for spawning every year, so their presence is quite predictable.  Furthermore, a total lack of fear of people makes them an easy target for spear fishers.  Finally, the Atlantic Goliath Grouper’s large size, slow growth, and ease of capture all contribute to slow its recovery, even where laws have been put in place to give it some or complete legal protection from fishing (e.g., in the USA and Brazil).  It is important to continue to monitor Atlantic Goliath Grouper population trends in order to determine whether or not the species is recovering or if stronger legal protection may be required.A note on a closely related species:  the Atlantic Goliath Grouper lives on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean – in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters and off the west coast of Africa.  A closely related species, the Pacific Goliath Grouper, is restricted to the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Peru.  Scientists only recently divided the species into two, based on their slightly different genetic makeup.  The two species are similar in both appearance and behavior, but little is known about the population trends or conservation status of the Pacific Goliath Grouper.To help support our work protecting sea life from dangerous threats, click here to donate today!Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "Adult Atlantic Salmon live in coastal seas and feed on pelagic invertebrates and some fishes.  During the oceanic portion of their life cycle, these fish are primarily concerned with growing and storing energy that they will require for successful reproduction.  This period typically lasts for 2-3 years.  Once they reach reproductive size, they begin a long migration to their preferred spawning ground, fair inland, in freshwater rivers.  Interestingly, though the three populations mix at sea, they divide into their respective groups to reproduce.  In fact, each individual Atlantic Salmon returns to spawn in the river where it hatched, so rivers around the north Atlantic are home to distinct subpopulations of this salmon.  Thousands of individuals migrate to and reach the spawning grounds at the same time.  Once they arrive, females dig nests in light gravel and lay their eggs on the river bottom.  Males fertilize the eggs externally, and then the females bury the nests.  Unlike the pacific salmons (such as the Chinook Salmon [link]), Atlantic Salmon do not die after reproducing just once.  They can repeat this cycle several times.  After they hatch, baby Atlantic Salmon spend approximately 2-3 years living in different riverine habitats as they slowly make their way to the ocean, where they stay until they reach maturity and begin the cycle again.  Though this lifecycle is typical of the species, it is not required for survival.  Some subpopulations are landlocked and replace the oceanic portion of their lifecycle with large, inland lakes.Atlantic Salmon are important oceanic prey for several species.  This salmon was historically also an important fishery species, and Atlantic Salmon fisheries have been regulated for at least 800 years in Europe.  In the ocean, large boats historically targeted this species in very large numbers.  While they migrate toward their spawning grounds, Atlantic Salmon are targeted by fishers using traps and other semi-permanent structures installed in rivers.  Unfortunately, overfishing, climate change, and competition from nonnative species all threaten Atlantic Salmon, and several subpopulations are critically endangered (very highly vulnerable to extinction) or even extinct.  Because individuals return to spawn in the river where they hatched, climate change is one of the most significant future threats to this species.  As rivers in the southern part of their range become too warm for eggs to survive, subpopulations that spawn in those rivers will almost certainly go extinct. Atlantic Salmon are one of the most aquacultured marine fishes and are farmed in many places around the world, including outside of their native range.  Now, essentially all of the Atlantic Salmon sold in the seafood industry is from farms rather than from wild populations.  Aquaculture of this magnitude presents its own problems, however, and escaped fish may threaten natural populations in the north Atlantic or may lead to establishment of invasive populations in other parts of the world where it is farmed.Additional Resources:"

There are more than 200 known species of scorpionfish in the ocean. Members of this fish family are commonly found in the Indian and South Pacific Oceans where water temperatures are temperate and coral reefs are plentiful. Coral reefs provide the perfect space for a scorpionfish to hide and hunt for prey and also avoid any potential predators brave enough to take a bite. But, the body of a scorpionfish is just as important as its habitat when it comes to remaining unseen. Scorpionfish are covered in feathery fins or skin flaps that help with camouflage against surrounding coral. Some scorpionfish are dull in color–mottled brown or yellow– while other species are bright red or orange, making them virtually invisible when hidden among either rocks or reefs.  Scorpionfish are also equipped with spines containing dangerous venom. When the spines pierce a predator, the venom is injected immediately at the point of contact. A sting from one of these spines can be potentially fatal to other animals and extremely painful to humans.Scorpionfish are exceptional sit-and-wait predators. Scorpionfish only hunt at night and spend daylight hours resting in crevices. They will remain in the shadows of rocks or reefs before pouncing on unsuspecting prey swimming by. Their diet consists of small fish, crustaceans and snails that also live in coral reefs. A scorpionfish’s mouth is wide in size, which allows the fish to quickly suck and swallow prey whole in one bite. Scorpionfish can also use their venom to stun prey before eating them. Predators of scorpionfish remain few, but sharks, rays and large snappers have been known to hunt the fish.Most scorpionfish species are less than two feet in size and have a lifespan of 15 years. A female scorpionfish may release upwards of 15,000 eggs into the water for fertilization by the males. Fertilized eggs float to the surface where egg-eating predators are less likely to get to them. After just two days the eggs will hatch and baby scorpionfish will remain near the surface until they are big enough to swim down to the reefs where the adults swim. Scorpionfish face few threats in our ocean—they are not commercially fished because of their venom, but some species may be caught as incidental bycatch when lines and hooks are set near reefs. Their coral reef habitat may also be in jeopardy due to warming oceans and global warming."

The Kemp's ridley is also distinguishable by its almost circular carapace, or shell, that is almost as wide as it is long and appears green on top, but pale yellow on the bottom. Kemp's ridley turtles primarily eat crabs, but will also prey on fish, jellyfish and small mollusks. Kemp's ridley sea turtles are perhaps most well known for their unique nesting habits. Female Kemp ridley's come together all at once in what is known as an arribada, which means \"arrival\" in Spanish. Nearly 95 percent of Kemp's ridley nesting worldwide occurs in Tamaulipas, Mexico. Nesting is usually between May and July, and females will lay up to three clutches of 100 eggs that must incubate for 50-60 days. Unfortunately, the unique nesting habits of Kemp’s ridley turtles also invite threats to the population. Predators like foxes, weasels, raccoons, dogs and even humans are known to eat exposed eggs on the beaches. Newly emerged hatchlings are also in danger of being snatched by predators as they make their way to the water for the first time.Kemp's ridley hatchlings spend up to 10 years in the open ocean before returning inshore to continue developing. Kemp's ridley turtles occupy \"neritic\" zones, which contain muddy or sandy bottoms where their preferred prey is plentiful. Even in the ocean, the Kemp's ridley rarely swims in waters deeper than about 160 feet. They will reach sexual maturity as early as seven years of age or as late as 15, and females will often return to nest on the same beach as they were hatched.Kemp's ridley sea turtles face many threats both on shore and in the ocean, making them critically endangered. Primary threats to Kemp's ridley survival include incidental capture in fishing gear, or bycatch, egg collection and climate change. Though egg collection has historically been a problem for this species, protections afforded to nesting beaches in 1966 by Mexico has allowed for slight increases in arribada size. In the 1990's, up to 55,000 loggerheads and kemp's ridleys were killed each year in shrimp trawls. Since then, better enforcement of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in trawl nets has allowed for a slight comeback of the population, but until there is a fishery-wide requirement, the Kemp's ridley will likely remain endangered. Watch our PSA with Lauren Conrad to learn why she needs your help protecting sea turtles and how you can get involved with our campaign.To help support our work protecting sea turtles from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a sea turtle from our store!Additional Resources:"

Despite living in cold climates, Gentoo penguins typically live in ice-free areas like flat, rocky beaches and low-lying cliffs where large colonies of individuals can gather. Like other penguin species, Gentoo penguins rely on the ocean for food and are never far from the water. These penguins take advantage of stream-lined bodies and strong “flippers” in the water to dive more than 600 feet deep and swim up to 22 miles an hour, the fastest of any other diving bird. Gentoo penguins primarily feed on crustaceans, fish and squid. Adult Gentoo penguins are relatively small, weighing about 12 pounds and standing 30 inches tall on average.When it comes to breeding and nesting, Gentoo penguins have been dubbed one of the more romantic seabirds in the animal kingdom. Gentoo penguin pairs start by building intricate nests of rocks and pebbles together, and individual pebbles may be shared between potential mates beforehand as a sign that they are interested in becoming a breeding pair. The nests are then used for laying the egg in during incubation, which lasts for close to 40 days. Males and females work together closely during the process, taking turns incubating the egg and forming long-lasting bonds with each other that continue after the chick has hatched. Many Gentoo penguins, once reaching sexual maturity at around 2 years old, will return to previous nesting sites year after year.Gentoo penguins are listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, largely because of apparent significant population declines on the sub-Antarctic islands on which they live. Collection of Gentoo eggs used to be widespread in parts of their range, but today increasing oil exploration, tourism and interactions with fisheries threaten populations. To help support our work protecting penguins from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a penguin from our store!Additional Resources:"

Just like penguins, they stand erect on land due to their legs being positioned at the rear of the body. Aside from islands around the Arctic and the Bering Sea, the little auk can also be found around Greenland, Iceland and northern Russia. The little auk is a migratory bird, traveling to the North Atlantic Ocean, sometimes as far south as the United Kingdom and parts of the U.S., at the onset of winter.The little auk takes advantage of cold temperatures and rocky shores ideal for breeding and foraging. Just like other seabirds, little auks need land for mating and nesting, but are entirely dependent on the sea for food. Despite their compact size and short wing span, little auks can dive to depths of up to 115 feet where they use their natural buoyancy to shoot back upwards through the water in a zig-zag pattern and capture prey. By diving deep and looking from below, prey is often illuminated by the surface light and easier to catch in one mouthful. Little auks also have the advantage of an extensible pouch in the throat that makes it easier to carry prey to nests.  In the spring and summer, little auks nest in large colonies—the largest of all auk species— among rocks and cliffs surrounding the water. Breeding pairs lay eggs in between small rocks or burrowed on a hillside. Competition over prime nesting spots is common among little auks, and dominant birds will sometimes chase opponents in the air until their nest site is secured. Similar to some penguin species, a bed of pebbles provides a safe space for egg incubation.The little auk has an extensive range, and as such, the IUCN Red List does not see the current population of little auks as threatened or vulnerable. Few threats are known to affect this seabird, but other seabird species have been known to be effected by changes in the environment and abandoned longlines or other fishing gear.To help support our work protecting seabirds from dangerous threats, click here to donate today!Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "Marbled electric rays are commonly found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean bordering Africa up to Norway, as well as parts of the Mediterranean Sea. In rocky reefs and seagrass beds, the marbled electric ray buries itself in muddy bottoms during the daylight hours. Oftentimes, only the ray’s eyes are visible above the sand. The black and brown speckled skin of these rays, resembling dark marbled floors, is ideal for camouflaging against the seafloor habitats where they live. At night, the marbled electric ray departs from its hiding spot to forage for prey. Marbled electric rays are generally found in waters no more than 100 feet deep.Electric rays are unique from other rays in that they lack venomous scales or barbs. Instead, electric rays generate a strong, electric discharge from massive and highly specialized electrogenic organs situated at the base of the pectoral fins. As an ambush predator, the marbled electric ray will wait patiently in the dark hours of the night until fish, such as gobies, mackerel or damselfish, swim pass. Then, the ray jumps on prey while emitting electrical shocks to stun it. These shocks may produce a charge up to 200 volts, instantly stunning or killing prey before the ray can distend its jaw for swallowing. Because of this ray’s formidable demeanor, few other predators of the sea dare to hunt electric rays. Some sharks and other large carnivorous fish have been known to confront marbled electric rays. Not much is known about the reproductive strategies of marbled electric rays, but scientists believe that the gestation period lasts up to 10 months and females may release five to 32 young. At birth, young marbled electric rays only measure less than six inches on average, but already possess fully functional electric organs to capture prey.The conservation status of the marbled electric ray remains data deficient as defined by the IUCN Red List, but these rays are known to be a product of bycatch in some trawl fisheries and bottom longlines. Marbled electric rays are not commercially important, so are often discarded back at sea if caught.  Catch rates and population trends are hard to assess across the ray’s range.To help support our work protecting rays from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a ray from our store!Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "The porcupine ray is aptly named for its prickly body that acts as armor against a litany of predators. Stingray species are often vulnerable to the appetites of hammerhead and bull sharks, killer whales and other carnivorous fish. Though the porcupine ray has a signature whip-like tail similar to other stingrays, theirs does not hold venom for stunting predators. The porcupine ray's body is flattened into an oval-shaped disc with a rounded snout, and is usually shaded brown or grey above and white below. Its black tail stands out against its light body, and appears darker towards the tip.  The porcupine ray inhabits the Indian Ocean and the Indo-West Pacific, concentrating around East Africa, the Red Sea and parts of Australia where tropical, inshore waters give way to coral reefs and sandy seafloors.The reproductive habits of porcupine rays have rarely been observed, but females most likely retain their eggs internally as most other stingrays do until the eggs are fully developed and then the female can give birth to a live litter. Newborn porcupine rays lack the species’ characteristic sharp thorns, but are still equipped with countless denticles on the upper part of the body. Porcupine rays forage for bottom-dwelling crustaceans, marine worms and fish that burrow into soft, sandy bottoms. Sharp rows of teeth in the ray's downward-facing jaws are ideal for breaking the hard, outer shells of its prey. Porcupine rays are benthic, which means they live near the sediment surface of the ocean. Benthic rays tend to \"ripple\" their fins to move around above the seafloor, in contrast to pelagic rays that flap their pectoral fins.Porcupine ray populations are declining today, and the species is considered vulnerable to extinction. Porcupine rays are not targeted by commercial fisheries, but they are often caught accidently by vessels in nearshore waters. Fewer porcupine rays are caught today as bycatch compared to years past, and researchers believe this means the species has been overexploited in its range and there are fewer individuals. Further, a porcupine ray’s preferred habitat is in populated coastal areas that are more susceptible to human activity.To help support our work protecting rays from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a ray from our store!Additional Resources: "

With its mouth wide open, this shark will pick up speed underwater through schools of fish, like sardines, herring and tuna, and spin in mid-air along the axis of its body while snapping its jaws for pieces of fish. The teeth of a spinner shark are narrow and triangular on both the upper and lower jaws. While this shark's jaws are powerful enough to cut through fish and even smaller sharks and squid, the spinner shark is not considered dangerous to humans.The spinner shark lives in subtropical waters in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, parts of South America and in the Indo-West Pacific, including the Red Sea, Japan and Australia. A highly migratory shark species, the spinner shark will form schools of several individuals and traverse the coasts of Florida and Louisiana into the Gulf of Mexico to reproduce and feed during the spring and summer. This shark is not a deep-sea swimmer, but instead prefers inshore to offshore waters no more than 350 feet deep, and juvenile spinner sharks may move into shallower bays with tides. Spinner sharks will grow to be about six to ten feet in length by adulthood, growing roughly two inches a year until maturity at 10 to 20-years-old. It has been said that smaller spinner sharks are found in the Atlantic, while the populations of spinner sharks in the Indo-West Pacific grow to a larger size. Like other sharks, the spinner shark will give birth to live young. An average litter size is three to 15 pups that will quickly move into shallow estuaries where food is abundant and predators are few.The spinner shark is listed as near threatened today by the IUCN Red List largely due to fishing pressures. This shark is commonly targeted by commercial fishers in the southeast U.S. and throughout the Gulf of Mexico. When caught, meat from a spinner shark is often sold under the name blacktip shark because the two species look so much alike, which means catch of this threatened species is likely underreported. Dried fins from spinner sharks are shipped to the Far East to be used in shark fin soup, a traditional delicacy in parts of Asia.

Sharks that are grouped into the dogfish family are so named because fishermen have observed these species chasing down smaller fish in dog-like packs. Schools of dogfish sharks numbering in the hundreds swim close together during the day, hunting herring, mackerel and capelin, as well as squid and jellyfish in some cases. Despite sharp spines, this dogfish consumes its meals by biting down on prey with sharp teeth and a strong jaw. Scientists believe that spiny dogfish eat less in the winter months when they swim in extreme depths of up to 2,900 feet below the surface. During spring, the sharks will return closer to the surface looking a little thinner, but will quickly move to warmer, coastal waters for summer feeding.With a slender body and pointed snout, the spiny dogfish is a compact shark species reaching a maximum of 39 inches in males and 49 inches in females. Their skin is grey to brown on top and becomes increasingly paler, or even white, on the belly with small white spots running down each side of the body. The spiny dogfish is a highly migratory species–one individual tagged in Washington made a 5,000-mile journey to Japan. The spiny dogfish also breaks records when it comes to gestation. These sharks have the longest pregnancy of any vertebrate at 22 to 24 months, or two years! Eggs develop in the female, gaining nutrients from yolk sacs, and live young are born at 20 to 33 centimeters. Even at a young age, newborn spiny dogfish pups may hunt fish two or three times their size. Predators of the spiny dogfish include larger sharks, seals, orcas, cod and red hake. To defend itself, the spiny dogfish may inject venom into predators from the two spines near the dorsal fins. Humans are only at risk if they improperly handle these sharks.Based on evidence of over-exploitation in their range and bycatch fisheries, global population of spiny dogfish are considered vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.  Global populations have declined by more than 30 percent over the last 75 years. In some parts of the world, this shark has been targeted for its meat and fins. In 2014, Oceana applauded steps taken by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to prohibit the finning of spiny dogfish. Other fisheries take the spiny dogfish as unwanted bycatch before discarding them back to sea.

                "description_full": "Tiger Sharks are aggressive predators, famous for eating just about anything they find or are able to capture.  They have been known to eat many different fishes and invertebrates, seabirds, sea turtles, some marine mammals, stingrays and other rays, smaller sharks, sea snakes, and scavenged dead animals, among other things.  Several Tiger Sharks have been known to eat garbage, including metal, plastic, wood, fishing gear, and other trash.  Though they are generalist predators, in some areas, Tiger Sharks likely specialize on certain highly available prey.  For example, in Hawaii, Tiger Sharks are known to regularly attack and eat Green Turtles and Hawaiian Monk Seals near the nesting beaches for those two species.  Scientists often observe individuals with missing flippers that have been bitten off by a Tiger.  At other island groups, Tiger Sharks are known to congregate near seabird rookeries during the times when young birds are learning to fly (and often end up on the sea surface).  Finally, Tiger Sharks have been known to bite people, and their rather large size leads to occasional fatalities, particularly in areas where large numbers of people use the ocean, recreationally.Tiger Sharks mate via internal fertilization and give live birth to as many as 80 or more small young.  Though they give live birth, Tiger Sharks do not connect to their young through a placenta, like in most mammals.  Instead, embryos develop inside individual eggs until they hatch.  Only then does the mother give birth to live juveniles.  After they are born, young Tiger Sharks are already natural predators, and they eat coastal fishes and invertebrates.  Adult Tiger Sharks have no natural predators, though juveniles may be eaten by other sharks, including adult Tigers.  For this and other reasons, juveniles and adults live in slightly different habitats.  Adults prefer the open coast and high-energy coral reefs, while juveniles are typically found in estuaries and protected bays.  This division of habitat use may offer some protection to the juveniles from cannibalistic adults. Though the Tiger Shark is thought to be a predominately coastal species, its geographic distribution includes all tropical and temperate waters around the world, so some individuals must migrate between island groups.  Experts consider Tiger Sharks to be ‘near threatened’ with extinction, noting the reduction in their numbers from targeted and accidental catch in fisheries.  Their reputation as a species that bites people (though very rarely) makes them a target of population control efforts in some places, a practice that is not supported by scientists anywhere that it occurs.To help support our work protecting sharks from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a shark from our store!Additional Resources:"

                "description_full": "Zebra sharks are nocturnal foragers, hunting for small fish, snails, sea urchins, crabs and other small invertebrates that hide out in crevasses. Even though they may not look as ferocious as their toothy relatives, the zebra shark’s body is perfectly adapted for snatching up prey. Barbels, or whisker-like organs at the front of their snouts, help them seek out prey, while a flexible body allows them to wriggle in tight spaces where small fishes are often hiding. They also have small mouths and strong gill muscles to easily suck up prey in one gulp. During daylight, the zebra shark prefers to rest on the ocean floor facing the current so they can efficiently pump water over their gills and breathe while remaining still. If the current is strong enough, this slow-moving shark species has been observed “surfing,” adjusting its fins to remain motionless in open water.During reproduction, male zebra sharks transfer sperm to the female using claspers, or modifications of the pelvic fins, and the female can lay up to four eggs at a time. The egg cases are covered in fine fibers that keep them anchored to the sea floor for about six and a half months while developing. A zebra shark pup may be less than a foot long at birth, but an adult can grow to be almost 12 feet long and have a tail that reaches half its full body length. Adult zebra sharks are non-aggressive, and have few predators other than larger shark species that may be lucky enough to catch one in its jaws.As with other sharks, the largest threat to zebra sharks is humans. The zebra shark is taken by a wide range of inshore fisheries and prized for its meat, which may be sold fresh or salt-dried in markets throughout Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and elsewhere. Its liver is also processed for vitamins and its fins are chopped off for use in shark fin soup that remains a traditional Chinese delicacy. Although the practice of shark finning is illegal in U.S. waters, fins can still be bought and sold from unsustainable foreign fisheries, which are lacking or have ineffective shark finning bans. The combination of these practices is driving down zebra shark populations in most of their range, and they are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN Red List. However, in Australia, the species is considered of Least Concern because it has a wide distribution and is not heavily fished. To help support our work protecting sharks from dangerous threats, click here to donate today. Or, symbolically adopt a shark from our store!Additional Resources:"
